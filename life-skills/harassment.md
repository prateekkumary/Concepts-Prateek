## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?



If you face or witness sexual harassment, it’s important to handle the situation thoughtfully and appropriately. Here’s a step-by-step approach to dealing with such incidents:

* ### Document the Incident:
    Write down what happened, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses. This documentation can be crucial if you decide to report the behavior later.

* ### Express Discomfort:
    If you feel safe and comfortable, let the person know that their behavior is unwelcome and must stop. Sometimes, the individual may not realize their behavior is inappropriate.

* ### Seek Support:
    Share your experience with friends, family, or colleagues who can offer emotional support and advice.
     Professional help can provide guidance and support for dealing with the emotional impact.

* ### Report the Behavior:
     Report the incident to your HR department, supervisor, or designated authority within your organization. Many workplaces have specific procedures for handling harassment complaints.
     If the harassment occurs in a formal setting, follow the established complaint process.


* ### Report the Incident:
    Report the behavior to the appropriate authorities within the organization, such as HR or a designated representative. Your report can help address and prevent further incidents.

* ### Stand Up Against Inappropriate Behavior:
    If you feel it is safe to do so, address the behavior immediately, especially if it is happening in real-time. This might involve speaking up to stop the behavior or intervening in a way that supports the victim.

* ### Support a Culture of Respect:
     Advocate for and participate in training and educational programs about sexual harassment and respectful behavior. A supportive environment can help prevent harassment and ensure it is addressed appropriately.

* ### Legal Actions:
  If the issue continues or isn’t resolved, you can explore legal options and register a complain.
