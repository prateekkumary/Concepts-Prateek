# Listening and Active Communication

## Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

* **Pay full attention** – Focus completely on the speaker without distractions.

* **Show understanding** – Use non-verbal cues like nodding and maintaining eye contact.

* **Avoid interrupting** – Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts before responding.


* **Provide feedback**– Summarize or paraphrase to confirm understanding.

* **Ask open-ended questions** – Encourage further discussion by asking clarifying or probing questions.
* **Empathize with the speaker**– Try to understand the speaker’s perspective and emotions.

* **Respond appropriately** – Offer thoughtful and relevant responses after fully understanding the message.
## Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
* **Paraphrasing** – Restate the speaker's message in your own words to ensure understanding.

* **Clarifying** – Ask questions to clear up any confusion or uncertainty about what was said.

* **Summarizing** – Provide an overview of the main points or ideas shared by the speaker to confirm comprehension.

* **Reflecting feelings** – Acknowledge and validate the speaker's emotions by reflecting their feelings back to them.

* **Validating**– Show empathy and understanding by affirming the speaker's experience or perspective.

## Question 3: What are the obstacles in your listening process?
 * **Distractions** – External noise or internal thoughts that pull attention away from the speaker.

 * **Prejudgments** – Making assumptions or forming opinions before fully hearing the speaker’s message.

 * **Emotional Reactions** – Strong emotions like anger or frustration can block the ability to listen effectively.

 * **Lack of Focus** – Difficulty staying attentive or present in the conversation, leading to missed details.

 * **Selective Listening** – Focusing on certain parts of the conversation while ignoring others, which limits understanding.

 ## Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?

 * **Eliminate distractions** – Remove external interruptions and focus entirely on the speaker.

 * **Practice mindfulness** – Stay present in the moment and avoid letting my mind wander during conversations.

 * **Suspend judgments** – Listen openly without forming premature opinions or assumptions.

 * **Manage emotions** – Keep emotions in check to avoid reacting defensively or missing key points.

 * **Ask clarifying questions** – Engage with the speaker to ensure I fully understand their message.

 ## Question 5: When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

 * **Avoiding conflict** – I might stay silent or agree to something I don't fully support to avoid an argument or confrontation.

 * **Feeling overwhelmed** – In situations where I feel anxious or unsure, I may not express my opinions or needs clearly.

 * **Dealing with authority** – I may hesitate to speak up in conversations with authority figures, opting to listen rather than share my thoughts.

 * **Not wanting to inconvenience others** – I might avoid asserting my preferences or asking for help to not burden others.

 ## Question 6: When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

 * **Feeling frustrated or stressed** – If I’m overwhelmed by emotions, I may express myself forcefully or impatiently.

 * **Perceiving unfairness or injustice** – I may become confrontational if I feel that I or someone else is being treated unfairly.

 * **Losing patience** – In situations where I feel others are not understanding my point or delaying decisions, I might respond aggressively.

 * **Feeling defensive** – If I feel attacked or criticized, I may respond in a harsh or hostile manner to protect myself.

 ## Question 7: When do you switch into Passive-Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?
 I might switch into a passive-aggressive communication style in day-to-day life when:

 * **Avoiding direct confrontation** – If I want to express dissatisfaction but don't feel comfortable doing so openly, I might use subtle or indirect methods.

 * **Feeling powerless or resentful** – When I feel I can't assert myself directly, I may show my frustration through sarcasm or passive resistance.

 * **Trying to suppress emotions** – If I’m upset but don't want to openly address the issue, I might withhold communication or agree verbally but act differently.

 * **Avoiding conflict while still expressing displeasure** – Instead of directly addressing the issue, I might use humor, silence, or non-verbal cues to show disagreement.


 ## Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive?

 * **Listen Actively:** Show respect for the other person's perspective by listening attentively and acknowledging their points before presenting your own.

 * **Practice Empathy:** Understand and consider the other person's feelings and viewpoints, which can help in crafting a response that is both firm and considerate.

 * **Set Boundaries:** Clearly define your limits and stand by them. For instance, if you’re unable to take on additional work, communicate this firmly but politely.

 * **Stay Calm and Composed:** Manage your emotions and avoid reacting defensively or aggressively. Keep the conversation focused on the issue at hand rather than personal attacks.

 * **Be Clear and Specific:** Clearly articulate what you need or expect without ambiguity. Provide concrete examples to ensure your message is understood.

 * **Use “I” Statements:** Express your feelings and needs directly by focusing on your own experience rather than blaming others. For example, say "I feel concerned when deadlines are missed" instead of "You never meet deadlines."

* **Request Feedback:** Ask for feedback on your communication style to identify areas for improvement and adjust your approach as needed.
