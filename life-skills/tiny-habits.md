# Tiny Habits

## What was the most interesting story or idea in this video?

The most interesting story in BJ Fogg's video was about his friend who wanted to build the habit of flossing regularly. Instead of aiming to floss all his teeth right away, he began by just flossing one tooth. This made the habit easy to start. Over time, as he became accustomed to the routine, he gradually began flossing all his teeth. This story highlights how to start with small, manageable habits can lead to bigger changes over time.


## How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
The **B = MAP** model is from Dr. BJ Fogg’s "Behavior Model," which explains how to create or change habits effectively. Here's a breakdown of the model:

**B = MAP**

**B** stands for Behavior and indicates that a behavior occurs when three elements—**M, A, and P**—are present simultaneously.
**M, A,** and **P** Explained

**M (Motivation):** The level of desire to perform the behavior. This can be driven by factors like wanting to experience pleasure or avoid pain. Higher motivation increases the likelihood of performing the behavior, even if it's difficult.

**A (Ability):** The ease or simplicity of performing the behavior. If a behavior is too complicated or requires too much effort, it becomes harder to adopt. Making the habit easier (requiring less effort) increases the chance of success.

**P (Prompt):** The trigger or cue that reminds you to perform the behavior. This could be a visual cue, a notification, or an existing habit that reminds you to take action.

## Why is it important to "shine" or celebrate after completing a habit?
Celebrating immediately after completing a habit creates a burst of positive emotions, making you feel good about what you've done.Emotions help solidify habits in the brain. When you celebrate, your brain releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward.

## What was the most interesting story or idea in this video?
The most interesting idea from the video is the concept of making small, daily improvements that add up over time. Small changes, like getting a better pillow for sleep or practicing a skill for just a few minutes each day, may not seem significant right away, but over time they can lead to major improvements. This idea was illustrated with the story of a cycling team that won the Tour de France by focusing on lots of small, gradual improvements.

## What is the book's perspective on identity?
The book suggests that our habits are closely tied to our identity. It encourages focusing on becoming the type of person who naturally has the habits we desire, rather than just focusing on outcomes.

## What does the book say about making a habit easier to do?
To make a habit easier, the book recommends simplifying the process.Modify your surroundings to make the desired behavior easier and the undesired behavior harder. For instance, if you want to read more, place a book next to your bed or couch, so it's within easy reach.

## What does the book say about making a habit harder to do?
To make a habit harder to do,you can introduce barriers or friction that make the process more difficult or less convenient.

## What steps can you take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive, easy, or satisfying?
**Habit:** Exercising regularly

I can make the cue obvious by placing my workout gear where I can easily see it.
I can make the habit more enjoyable by listening to my favorite music or joining a fun class.
I’ll keep the workouts simple by starting with short and easy routines.
To make it satisfying, I’ll track my progress and reward myself with something healthy or relaxing.

## Choose one habit you'd like to reduce or eliminate. What steps can you take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?
**Habit:** Reducing screen time

I can set a specific time to stop using devices each day.
I can place my electronic devices on silent.
I can use apps that limit my screen time.
I can make my screen less appealing by switching it to grayscale.
