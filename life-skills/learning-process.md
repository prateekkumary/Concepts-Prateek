# Learning Process


## 1.What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a learning method developed by the renowned physicist Richard Feynman to help understand complex concepts more deeply. It’s particularly effective for improving comprehension, simplifying difficult ideas, and identifying gaps in knowledge.


## 2.What was the most interesting story or idea in the TED talk by Barbara Oakley?


Oakley explains that when we focus on learning a difficult concept, we use the focused mode, which is like concentrating intently on a single point. However, sometimes this intense focus leads to mental blocks when we can’t understand something right away. In contrast, the diffuse mode allows our brain to relax and make connections more freely, like stepping back and seeing the bigger picture.

## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

* **Focused (Active) Mode of Thinking** : The focused mode is when you're actively concentrating on a task or problem, using deliberate and intense mental effort. It engages specific areas of the brain that are directly related to the task you're working on.

* **Diffused Mode of Thinking** :The diffused mode is a more relaxed, big-picture way of thinking. It involves different, broader neural networks that allow your brain to make connections across various areas and come up with creative solutions. This mode is less linear and more free-flowing.


## 4. What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

* Define Your Goals
* Gather Preliminary Information
* Create a Learning Plan
* Choose Learning Resources
* Active Engagement
* Practice and Apply Knowledge
* Review and Reflect
* Seek Feedback


## 5. What are some actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

* **Define Objectives**: Establish specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for what you want to learn.

* **Create a Learning Plan**:Outline the steps needed to achieve these goals, including milestones and deadlines.

* **Minimize Distractions**: Find a quiet, organized space for studying.

* **Explain Concepts Simply**: Teach what you’ve learned to someone else or write about it in simple terms to deepen your understanding.

* **Set Small Rewards**: Reward yourself for reaching milestones to stay motivated.

* **Manage Stress**: Practice stress-relief techniques such as meditation, exercise, or hobbies to maintain a healthy balance.
