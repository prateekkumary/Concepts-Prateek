Additionally, I will use available resources like documentation, Google, and Stack Overflow before seeking help and take full responsibility for project delivery and quality. Errors and confusion will be embraced as learning tools, and I will maintain confidence, enthusiasm, and a focus on mastery until I can solve problems with ease.
